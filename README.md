# Introduction
Hi, this is a very early WIP emulator for the gameboy handheld system, it is not gona be perfect, and is just a project i am working on own my own currently.
# how to build and run
Clone the project to a folder, open a terminal in the folder and type `npm install` 

After npm has done its thing, you can run the tests if you feel like with `npm test`

Build the project with `npx webpack`

Open the `index.html`file located in `dist/index.html`.

**as you can see, there is not alot going on in index.html currently, however the tests are fun to look at i guess...** ðŸ˜‹
